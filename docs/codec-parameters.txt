List of possible offers is gathered from rtp caps 
- fixed paremeters are copied as-is, others are not included
This is the global list of CodecBlueprints. It is loaded once and never changes.

For each RTP stream:

The application can pass a list of FsCodec with its desired
properties, the same codec can be there more than once if the app
desires to have the same codec many times with different properties. This
list of FsCodec can contain codec ids (to force specific codecs into
specific ids), otherwise if the codec id is < 0 or > 127, a dynamic
codec id will be attributed... To remove a codec from the list of
offered codecs, the codec id is set to a special value.

For each loaded codec (aka CodecBlueprint), we check if there is one
or more compatible (as in gstcaps comptatible) section in the passed
list. If there are some, we replace the autogenerated offered codec
for that codec by ones which correspond to the union of the fixed
parameters from the config file and element... This makes the 
local_codec_association table.  From there we generate the
local_codecs list that points to this local_codecs_association table,
this is valid until a new list of FsCodecs is passed. The
codec_associations table is initialized as a copy of local_codec_associations.

For SDP codec negociation: since there are codec-specific things, we
will use a table of tuples (media_type, encoding-name, function) where
the function is: 
FsCodec *sdp_codec_negotiate(GstCaps *rtpcaps, FsCodec *mycodec, FsCodec *hiscodec); 
This function will return the negociated FsCodec or NULL if its
impossible to reconcile the remote and the local one. It should always
return something when being fed a valid reply from our offer. And we
will also have generic function that check if everything present in
both is identical.

We store the negociated codecs in codec_associations. From these
negociated FsCodecs, we'll generate Caps to be used for the
pt_caps_table. We always accept the remote PTs even if they dont match
the ones we have locally (but in this case we print a big warning). If
there was an offered codec that was rejected, we remove the codec from
the codec_associations, but we keep a NULL entry so that the PT is not
re-used. If a remote PT was rejected, we also store a NULL in
codec_associations to prevent the re-use of that PT.

If the user wants to initiate a new negociation, he can optionally
give farsight a new list of FsCodec. This list will be merged into
local_codec_associations, while not re-using already used PTs by
looking at codec_associations. Using the same process used the first
time.  Then the user can get the list of local codecs again. The user
then passes a new list of remote_codecs, codec_associations is
regenerated from local_codec_associations and remote_codecs, while
keeping NULLs in the place of old codecs to make sure the PTs are not
re-used.

If the remote end initiates a new codec negociation, we get a new
list of remote codecs, and we merge it into a new codec_associations,
if its not empty, we replace the old one with it and set_remote_codec
succeeds. If its empty, set_remote_codec fails and we keep the old
codec_associations. get_codec_intersection which will return a
list of codecs from the codec_associations table.
